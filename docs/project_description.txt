Perfect — this is exactly the **right MVP demo to build first**.
This single feature demonstrates almost your entire platform vision:

✅ AI + parsing
✅ vector RAG matching
✅ self-hosted LLM use
✅ scoring logic
✅ enterprise workflow

Below is a **practical, end-to-end guide** to build your **Resume-JD Matching Demo MVP** using **synthetic data** only.

---

# ✅ DEMO GOAL

> Input **one job description** + **multiple resumes** →
> Output **ranked candidate list** by fit score + reasoning.

This demo will showcase:

* Resume parsing
* Skill matching
* Experience relevance checks
* Vector similarity scoring
* Filter thresholds
* Clear explainable decision output

---

---

# ✅ DEMO ARCHITECTURE

Since this is a demo (no infra yet), keep it **local + simple**.

# ✅ STEP-BY-STEP BUILD PLAN

---

---

## 1️⃣ CREATE SYNTHETIC DATA

Start with **3–5 fake resumes + 1 job description**.

Example:

---

### JD — IT Sales Manager

```
Looking for Sales Manager with 5+ years experience selling SaaS products,
B2B lead generation, CRM tools (Salesforce), deal management,
and enterprise account handling.
```

---

### Resume #1 — Strong match

```
9 years SaaS sales, Salesforce CRM specialist,
enterprise accounts, lead generation, quota ownership.
```

### Resume #2 — Partial match

```
Pharmaceutical sales rep,
medical channel management,
doctor relationship building.
```

### Resume #3 — Weak match

```
Retail store supervisor,
team handling, customer engagement.
```

---

---

---

## 2️⃣ EXTRACT TEXT

(Demo – everything can be .txt initially)

```python
# resumes = ["resume1.txt", "resume2.txt"]
# jd = "jd.txt"
```

---

---

## 3️⃣ STRUCTURE TEXT → JSON

Call your local LLM with this instruction:

```
Extract candidate information in JSON format:

{
  "skills": [],
  "experience_years": "",
  "industry": "",
  "tools": []
}
```

Now each resume becomes:

```json
{
  "skills": ["SaaS sales","lead generation","enterprise accounts"],
  "experience_years": 9,
  "industry": "IT",
  "tools": ["Salesforce"]
}
```

---

---

---

## 4️⃣ GENERATE EMBEDDINGS

Use open-source embeddings:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

resume_embeddings = model.encode(resumes)
jd_embedding = model.encode(jd)
```

---

---

## 5️⃣ STORE & SEARCH (FAISS)

```python
import faiss

index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(384)
index.add(resume_embeddings)

D, I = index.search([jd_embedding], k=3)
```

✅ This gives the best similarity order instantly.

---

---

---

## 6️⃣ SCORE CALCULATION

Blend similarity + rules:

```python
final_score = (
    0.50 * semantic_similarity +
    0.25 * skill_overlap_score +
    0.15 * experience_score +
    0.10 * industry_bonus
)
```

---

---

---

## 7️⃣ FILTER RESULTS

```python
shortlist = [c for c in candidates if c.score > 65]
```

---

---

---

## 8️⃣ FINAL OUTPUT

CLI or Streamlit UI:

| Rank        | Name | Score                                | Why |
| ----------- | ---- | ------------------------------------ | --- |
| 🥇 Resume 1 | 92%  | SaaS + Salesforce + 9 yrs            |     |
| 🥈 Resume 2 | 61%  | Sales experience but pharma industry |     |
| 🥉 Resume 3 | 28%  | Retail domain mismatch               |     |

# ✅ DEMO FILE STRUCTURE

```bash
resume-matcher-demo/
├─ data/
│   ├─ jd.txt
│   ├─ resume_1.txt
│   └─ resume_2.txt
├─ match_engine.py
├─ llm_parser.py
├─ scorer.py
└─ app.py
```

---

---

---

---

---

# ✅ LLM ALTERNATIVE FOR DEMO SIMPLICITY

Since you may not have GPUs yet:

**Use this fallback for MVP:**

* Skip LLM extraction
* Use pure text embeddings directly

That alone shows:

✅ Intelligent matching
✅ Ranking
✅ Industry differences

Once ready, **swap in GPT-OSS for smarter structuring.**

---

---

---

---

# ✅ OPTIONAL STREAMLIT DEMO UI

```
pip install streamlit faiss-cpu sentence-transformers
```

Then:

```python
streamlit run app.py
```

Provides:

* Upload JD
* Upload resumes
* “Match Candidates” button

---

---

---

---

---

# ✅ WHAT THIS DEMO PROVES TO CLIENTS

✅ AI candidate matching works
✅ Fully offline AI stack works
✅ No external APIs used
✅ Explainable ranking logic
✅ Works across IT vs Pharma examples

A perfect proof-of-concept.

# ✅ ILLUSTRATIVE WORKFLOW

```
Upload JD + resumes
      ↓

# 🚀 THIS DEMO IS PERFECT

This single demo:

* Sells your entire system vision
* Is fast to build (1–2 days)
* Avoids production infra initially
